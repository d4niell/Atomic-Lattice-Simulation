Atomic Lattice Simulation for Sound Speed in Copper

This project simulates the motion of atoms in a one-dimensional copper lattice to calculate the speed of sound in copper. The simulation uses physical constants and parameters such as atomic mass, density, and Young's modulus to model the system. The positions, velocities, and accelerations of the atoms are updated using Euler's method, and the results are visualized and saved as images. The project also records and plots the calculated sound speed over time.
